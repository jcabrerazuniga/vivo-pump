Building a VIVO is greatly simplified using these examples.

## Order

The following order is recommended:

1. Dates
1. Concepts
1. Orgs
1. Journals
1. Locations

These items are fundamental to all VIVOs and will be used by the subsequent examples.

1. People

Getting your people into VIVO, in their departments, positions you for the remaining work of filling out their profiles.

1. Positions
1. Pubs

These are the elements of the profile most VIVO installations focus on.  Other examples can be considered optional and
provide additional detail about each person and their work.

1. Courses
1. Grants

Adding courses taught and grants received strengthens the ability to
do social network analysis and use the VIVO system for producing basic reports and visualizations.

1. Awards
1. Education
1. Mentoring
1. Memberships
1. Service

Awards, Education, Mentoring, Memberships, and Service can be added as needed to further deepen the representation 
of the work of each scholar.
